# Movie Website

The Movie Website project is a web application that allows users to view and interact with a list of movies. It retrieves movie data from a local server and displays it on a webpage. Users can click on a movie title to view additional details about the movie and purchase tickets for the first movie.

## Features

- Click on a movie title to view additional details, including the movie poster, description, showtime, and runtime.
